Temporal coding refers to the encoding of information in the timing or pattern of spikes generated by neurons while rate coding elies on the frequency or rate at which neurons generate spikes to encode information.
For latency coding it is the encoding of information based on the time it takes for a neuron to respond to a stimulus , while synchronous coding uses  multiple neurons firing together in a coordinated manner to encode information. Turning curves describes the firing rate of a neuron using specific indicators such as frequency and direction. This provides sesitivity of then neuron to the inputs. Finally for population codes those are the codes that repersent the activity of multiple neurons through encoding.
